  "summary": "Implements a responsive timer screen with event selector, official cubing.js (CDN) scramble generation, a TwistyPlayer-based visualization panel, WCA-style space/touch hold controls, and a custom orange/amber theme. However, the event list is incomplete vs. “all official WCA events”, and visualization fallback/unsupported-event handling is not clearly implemented (it defaults to 3x3). Also includes Internet Identity/auth scaffolding that was explicitly a non-goal.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Event selector includes all official WCA events (one entry per event), with English names, and drives scramble generation/visualization for the selected event.",
      "reason": "The provided WCA_EVENTS list only contains a subset of official events (e.g., it includes 333, 222, 444... plus some BLD/FMC/OH, but does not show the full current WCA set). From the diff summary alone, it does not satisfy “all official WCA events”.",

      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "If an event does not support a visualization, show a clear English fallback message (e.g., \"No visualization available for this event\").",
      "reason": "ScrambleVisualizer always maps unknown/unsupported eventIds to a default puzzleName of '3x3x3' rather than detecting unsupported events and showing a fallback. The fallback message only appears on exceptions, not on unsupported events.",
