  "summary": "Login modal component was added and TimerScreen now contains first-visit auto-open logic gated by auth initialization and a localStorage flag. The modal’s sign-in button calls useInternetIdentity().login() on user click and closes on successful login. However, the diff excerpt does not provide concrete evidence that the required header login icon/button (with keyboard accessibility and an English aria-label) was implemented in TimerScreen.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Add a login icon/button to the header in `frontend/src/components/TimerScreen.tsx` that opens the same login modal later on demand, accessible via keyboard with an English accessible label (e.g., aria-label=\"Sign in\").",
      "reason": "TimerScreen.tsx is truncated and the provided snippet does not show any header UI or a login icon/button with an aria-label and click handler to open the modal. Without seeing that part of the file, implementation cannot be verified from the diff summary.",
