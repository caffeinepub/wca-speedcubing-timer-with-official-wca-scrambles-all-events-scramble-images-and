  "summary": "The diff shows inspection countdown and warning refs being reset when starting a new inspection, but the provided truncated hook snippet does not show an explicit reset occurring on solve completion / transition to the \"stopped\" state. Additionally, non-requested meta/project-tracking files were modified.",
  "missing_requirements": [

      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Reset the inspection countdown back to 15.00 seconds immediately after every solve is completed (timer transitions to \"stopped\"), regardless of prior inspection countdown value.",
      "reason": "In the visible diff, inspectionTime is reset in startInspection(), but there is no shown logic that resets inspectionTime to exactly 15000ms at solve completion / when state becomes \"stopped\". Since the file is truncated, this behavior cannot be verified from the provided evidence.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/hooks/useWcaTimerControls.ts (truncated): shows setInspectionTime(15000) inside startInspection(), but no shown reset on \"stopped\" transition."

      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Reset inspection-warning state after each solve completion so 8s and 5s warnings can trigger normally on the next inspection, without playing immediately on solve completion.",
      "reason": "In the visible diff, warning flags are reset in startInspection(), but there is no shown logic that resets warning state at solve completion / on transition to \"stopped\" (and ensures no warning audio plays immediately upon solve completion). This cannot be confirmed from the truncated snippet.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/hooks/useWcaTimerControls.ts (truncated): has8SecondWarningRef/has5SecondWarningRef are set false in startInspection(), but no shown reset on solve completion."
