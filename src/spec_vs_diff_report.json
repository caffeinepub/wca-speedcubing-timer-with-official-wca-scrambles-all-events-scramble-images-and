  "summary": "Auth alignment work is partially evidenced: backend adds Result-style types and a `signup` method; frontend updates `useEmailPasswordAuth` and `LoginModal` to call `signup/login/validateSession` and surface errors. However, the diff does not provide evidence that all required backend methods (`login`, `validateSession`, `logout`) are implemented/exported, nor that the generated frontend backend-actor type declarations were regenerated/updated to include these methods.",

      "requirement": "Backend canister must export callable methods named `signup`, `login`, `validateSession`, and `logout` with structured Result-style return types and proper session invalidation.",
      "reason": "The diff snippet for `backend/main.mo` shows new types and the `signup` method, but does not show any implementation/export of `login`, `validateSession`, or `logout` (file content is truncated). Without explicit evidence of these methods, the requirement cannot be confirmed as implemented.",

      "requirement": "Regenerate/update the frontend backend-actor type declarations so the compiled frontend actor type includes `signup`, `login`, `validateSession`, and `logout`.",
      "reason": "No modified files in the diff summary appear to be the generated canister interface/type declaration files (e.g., declarations/did bindings). The hook casts `actor as backendInterface`, but there is no evidence that `backendInterface` itself was updated/regenerated to include the required methods.",
      "evidence": [
